It will help our resources to protect IBM, our brand, and our clients, and maintain the trust of those whose personal information we process.\\n \\nThus, IBM as demonstrated for the past two and half years, is very well positioned to deliver services remotely. We believe that if remote work is embraced as part of innovation and technological change, it has the potential to improve productivity, attract and retain talent, and assist in the transition to a low carbon economy.\\n\\nInput:\\nQ: How do you handle data security and privacy with remote working employees ?\\nIBM allows hybrid work environment, a typical week is made up of time spent working from home plus from IBM offices for 3 days.\\nAlso, during mid-March 2020, IBM has had most of our global workforce working remotely across 175 countries and supported all our clients without any interruptions.
